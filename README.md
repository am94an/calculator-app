## Features

- **Basic arithmetic operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Advanced mathematical functions**: 
  - Exponentiation (`^`), square roots (`√`), logarithms (`log`, `ln`).
  - Trigonometric functions: Sine (`sin`), cosine (`cos`), tangent (`tan`).
  - Hyperbolic functions (`hyp`), inverse functions, and factorials (`nCr`).
- **Memory and History**: Clear, delete, and replay previous calculations.
- **Scientific calculator functions**: Support for complex expressions and scientific notation.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: The app is built using React to manage state and handle user input dynamically.
- **CSS**: The app uses CSS for styling and layout management.
- **JavaScript**: Core logic for calculations and handling user interactions.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/am94an/calculator-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate into the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd calculator-app
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The app will start running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Buttons**: Click any button to input numbers, operators, or functions.
- **Clear (`AC`)**: Clears the current input.
- **Delete (`DEL`)**: Removes the last character from the input.
- **Equals (`=`)**: Computes the result of the current expression.

### Mathematical Operations Supported:

- **Basic**: `+`, `-`, `×`, `÷`
- **Exponentiation**: `^`, `x^3`, `x^2`
- **Square Root**: `√`
- **Logarithms**: `log()`, `ln()`
- **Trigonometry**: `sin()`, `cos()`, `tan()`
- **Scientific Functions**: `nCr`, `hyp`, `EXP`
